## About the Dataset
The "Lions or Cheetahs - Image Classification" dataset is a collection of images downloaded from the Open Images Dataset V6, containing photographs of both lions and cheetahs. This dataset has been compiled for the purpose of training and evaluating image classification algorithms.

The dataset contains a total of 200 images. The images have been labeled as either "lion" or "cheetah" and are stored in separate directories within the dataset.

This dataset can be used for a variety of tasks related to image classification, including developing and testing deep learning algorithms, evaluating the effectiveness of different image features and classification techniques, and comparing the performance of different models.
